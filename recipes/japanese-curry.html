                <li>¼ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>

                <li>2 carrots (6.7 oz, 190 g)</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Prepare Ingredients</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Peel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Grate the ginger. You will need 1 tsp of grated ginger, including the juice. Mince the garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Grate the apple. My apple today is a lunchbox apple (smaller than regular), so I used the entire apple (yielded ½ cup or 120 ml grated apple). If your apple is regular size, use ½-¾ apple.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut off the extra fat from the chicken and discard it. Then cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it's called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Cook the Curry</h4>

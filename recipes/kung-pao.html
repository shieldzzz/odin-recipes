                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <h4>For the Chicken:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine chicken, soy sauce, wine, sugar, sesame oil, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Set aside for 20 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>For the Stir-Fry</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine chicken stock, soy sauce, wine, vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, and sesame oil in a small bowl and whisk together until homogenous. Set aside.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add chicken, spread into a single layer, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Continue cooking, tossing and stirring frequently, until the exterior is opaque but chicken is still slightly raw in the center, about 2 minute longer. Transfer to a clean bowl and set aside.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Wipe out wok and heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over high heat until smoking. Add bell peppers and celery and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until brightly colored and browned in spots, about 1 minute. Add peanuts and toss to combine.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Push vegetables up side of wok to clear a space in the center. Add garlic, ginger, scallions, and dried chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return chicken to wok and toss to combine. Stir sauce and add to wok. Cook, tossing, until sauce thickens and coats ingredients and chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute longer. Serve immediately.</li>
